Tree-Box Css is a project written in Haskell.
In this project I combine the last projects developped.
I am using the inheritance and the boxcss project.

# Download from Git  (http://github.com/carliros/Inheritance)
# In order to get installed, you will need:

    * wxhaskell (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/wx)
    * uulib (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uulib)
    * uuagc (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uuagc)

# Use the Makefile to compile and install: make all
# To run, use the generated file: ./tbox
  There are some examples in the test directory.
